# This is a template for a configuration.
# A message requires the primary and secondary fields, the 'require-player-data' field is false by default.
# Placeholders are automatically replaced if PlaceholderAPI is installed.
# If 'require-player-data' is set to true, then the stored player data will be used (if found).
# Make sure to have at least one message that doesn't need player data, because if they all tho then they all will be skipped.
# You can also use formatting codes for this. (&a, &k...)

# You can use this to disable the storing of player data.
# This will make it so that requires-player-data is ALWAYS true for all messages, and so that player data is deleted.
